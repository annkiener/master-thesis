This thesis presents a Mixed Reality (MR) simulation designed to enhance empathy in medical students towards patients with schizophrenia. The simulation utilizes MR technology to immerse users in the experiences of individuals with schizophrenia, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by patients, with the focus on auditory hallucinations as symptoms. The user study involved a pretestâ€“posttest design approach, conducted on 29 students, incorporating feedback from healthcare professionals to ensure the simulations effectiveness and relevance. The results indicate that the MR experience shows potential to increase empathy in medical students, however further research opportunities should be taken in order to improve the findings of this project.
