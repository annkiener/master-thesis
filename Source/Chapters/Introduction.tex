\emph{The purpose of a report is to transmit coherent information on a subject to the target readers. Reports are usually technical and should be based on verifiable facts or experiments. It is not a chronological description of your work. Obviously, the requirements of your readers (and tutors especially) must be taken into account: what information is requested, how much does the reader know already, what interests him/her? Write your report in such a way that your fellow students will be able to understand it and can put the contained information to use. Try to use short sentences to explain your work rather than long never-ending sentences.}

\subsection{Project Background}
