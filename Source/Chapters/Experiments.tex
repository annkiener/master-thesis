\chapter{Experiments}
\label{ch:experiments}

Short abstract to the chapter (a quick summary of all the sections)

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the list of experiments and provide the rationale (what do you want to demonstrate with these experiments?)
\item Describe all the settings needed to carry out the experiments (as if you instructed someone else to replicate them)
\item Structure the experiments meaningfully: For example, first all synthetic experiments and then all experiments on real data.
Another important section is to show Ablation studies, where one can demonstrate the effect of each component in the proposed solution.
\item Provide both quantitative (numbers, overall statistics) and qualitative (pictures, some examples) results.
\item Provide critical analysis of both quantitative and qualitative experiments: Why did something work or not work? Why better/worse?
\item Focus on critical cases: Worst errors/Best performance examples. Discuss them.
\item Do the experiments demonstrate achieving the original objective? Is the analysis making conclusions about the original objectives?
\end{itemize}
