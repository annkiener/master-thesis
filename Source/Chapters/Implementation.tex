\label{ch:implementation}

\emph{In this section, you should present what you have done. How things have been implemented and how they work.
Please avoid putting lines and lines of code here. But you can highlight some important elements of your implementations (some important part of the code, if necessary).}

\section{Structure of the Simulation}
\emph{Explain why you chose this structure and why you chose these hallucinations and sentences}
