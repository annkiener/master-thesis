\label{ch:conclusions}

\emph{This is a very important part of a report. Give all relevant conclusions, even negative. Stress novelty and scientific or industrial impact. Also new insights, outlook and recommendations for improvement should be put here. However, do not introduce results or concepts that belong in the body of the report. Bring structure in your conclusions.}
