\item The work should be grouped meaningfully (according to the conventions in the topic) so that it is easier to get an overview.
\item The number of references should be $\ge 20$ for a BSc thesis and $\ge 40$ for an MSc thesis.
\item Introduce relevant notation and background knowledge if needed (possibly in a separate chapter)
\end{itemize}
