\chapter{Background/Prior Work}
\label{ch:background}
\emph{This chapter can also be split into two chapters, one with the background knowledge and notation, and the other with prior work, references.}

Short abstract to the chapter (a quick summary of all the sections)

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the prior work relevant to the topic
\item The work should be grouped meaningfully (according to the conventions in the topic) so that it is easier to get an overview.
\item The number of references should be $\ge 20$ for a BSc thesis and $\ge 40$ for an MSc thesis.
\item Introduce relevant notation and background knowledge if needed (possibly in a separate chapter)
\end{itemize}
