Empathy is a vital skill in medical care, yet it often declines during medical training. This thesis investigates whether a short Mixed Reality (MR) simulation—designed to recreate typical symptoms of schizophrenia—can increase both **affective** and **cognitive empathy** in medical students. 
The simulation uses passthrough-enabled MR to project auditory and visual hallucinations into the user's real-world environment via the Meta Quest 3 headset.

Participants are tested using a customized version of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and emotional response questionnaires before and after the simulation. 
The study aims to explore whether MR technology can offer an effective, realistic, and ethically sound tool for fostering empathy in clinical education.
